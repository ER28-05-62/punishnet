# Plans

In the future I am going to add:
1. Vulnerability Scanner.
2. XSS Attack Tool/Scanner.
3. Web Application Exploits Assembly.
4. Advenced Port Scanner. 
  (performs scanning and shows service's version 
   runinng on each open port)

Follow me, and I will have more motivation to add new functions to this project.
