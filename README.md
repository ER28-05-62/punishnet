# Description
punishnet - is a network scanning tool. 
Though it can only perform fast port scanning.

# Plans
In the future I am going to add:
1. Vulnerability Scanner.
2. Advenced Port Scanner. 
  (performs scanning and shows version of service 
   runinng on each open port)
3. XSS Attack Tool/Scanner.
4. Web Application Exploits Assembly.

Follow me, and I will have more motivation to add new functions to this project.
